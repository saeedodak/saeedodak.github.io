	On Crossing-Families in Planar Point Sets
	</summary>
	A k-crossing family in a point set S in general position is a set of k segments spanned by points of S such that all k segments mutually cross. In this short note we present two statements on crossing families which are based on sets of small cardinality: (1) Any set of at least 15 points contains a crossing family of size 4.
	(2) There are sets of n points which do not contain a crossing family of size larger than 8⌈ n ⌉. Both results improve the previously best known bounds.

	Classes of Graphs Which Approximate the Complete Euclidean Graph
	</summary>
	Let S be a set of N points in the Euclidean plane, and let d(p,q) be the Euclidean distance between points p and q in S. Let G(S) be a Euclidean graph based on S and let G(p,q) be the length of the shortest path in G(S) between p and q. We say a Euclidean graph G(S)t-approximates the complete Euclidean graph if, for every p, q ~ S, G(p, q)/d(p, q) < t. In this paper we present two classes of graphs which closely approximate the complete Euclidean graph. We first consider the graph of the Delaunay triangulation of S, DT(S). We show that DT(S) (2~/(3cos(It/6))~ 2.42)- approximates the complete Euclidean graph. Secondly, we define 0(S), the fixed-angle 0-graph (a type of geometric neighbor graph) and show that O(S) ((1/cos0X1/(1-tan0)))-approximates the complete Euclidean graph.

	On Range Searching with Semialgebraic Sets II
	</summary>
	Let P be a set of n points in Rd. We present a linear-size data structure for answering range queries on P with constant-complexity semialgebraic sets as ranges, in time close to O(n1−1/d). It essentially matches the performance of similar structures for simplex range searching, and, for d ≥ 5, significantly improves earlier solutions by the first two authors obtained in 1994. This almost settles a long-standing open problem in range searching.
	The data structure is based on the polynomial-partitioning technique of Guth and Katz [arXiv:1011.4105], which shows that for a parameter r, 1 < r ≤ n, there exists a d-variate polynomial f of degree O(r1/d) such that each connected component of Rd \ Z(f) contains at most n/r points of P, where Z(f) is the zero set of f. We present an efficient randomized algorithm for computing such a polynomial partition, which is of independent interest and is likely to have additional applications.

	Searching for the closest-pair in a query translate
	</summary>
	We consider a range-search variant of the closest-pair problem. Let Γ be a fixed shape in the plane. We are interested in storing a given set of n points in the plane in some data structure such that for any specified translate of Γ, the closest pair of points contained in the translate can be reported efficiently. We present results on this problem for two important settings: when Γ is a polygon (possibly with holes) and when Γ is a general convex body whose boundary is smooth. When Γ is a polygon, we present a data structure using O(n) space and O(log n) query time, which is asymptotically optimal. When Γ is a general convex body with a smooth boundary, we give a near-optimal data structure using O(n log n) space and O(log2 n) query time. Our results settle some open questions posed by Xue et al. [SoCG 2018].

	Improved Bounds for Track Numbers of Planar Graphs
	</summary>
	A track layout of a graph consists of a vertex coloring and a total order of each color class, such that no two edges cross between any two color classes. The track number of a graph is the minimum number of colors required by a track layout of the graph.
	This paper improves lower and upper bounds on the track number of several fam- ilies of planar graphs. We prove that every planar graph has track number at most 225 and every planar 3-tree has track number at most 25. Then we show that there exist outerplanar graphs whose track number is 5, which leads to the best known lower bound of 8 for planar graphs. Finally, we investigate leveled planar graphs and tighten bounds on the track number of weakly leveled graphs, Halin graphs, and X-trees.

	Layered Separators in Minor-Closed Graph Classes with Applications
	</summary>
	Graph separators are a ubiquitous tool in graph theory and computer science. However, in some applications, their usefulness is limited by the fact that the separator can be as large as Ω(√n) in graphs with n vertices. This is the case for planar graphs, and more generally, for proper minor-closed classes. We study a special type of graph separator, called a layered separator, which may have linear size in n, but has bounded size with respect to a different measure, called the width. We prove, for example, that planar graphs and graphs of bounded Euler genus admit layered separators of bounded width. More generally, we characterise the minor-closed classes that admit layered separators of bounded width as those that exclude a fixed apex graph as a minor.
	We use layered separators to prove O(log n) bounds for a number of problems where O(√n) was a long-standing previous best bound. This includes the nonrepetitive chromatic number and queue-number of graphs with bounded Euler genus. We extend these results with a O(log n) bound on the nonrepetitive chromatic number of graphs excluding a fixed topological minor, and a logO(1) n bound on the queue-number of graphs excluding a fixed minor. Only for planar graphs were logO(1) n bounds previously known. Our results imply that every n-vertex graph excluding a fixed minor has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with n logO(1) n volume, whereas the previous best bound was O(n3/2).}}

	On Generating Triangle-Free Graphs
	</summary>
	We show that the problem to decide whether a graph can be made triangle-free with at most k edge deletions remains NP-complete even when restricted to planar graphs of maximum degree seven. In addition, we provide polynomial-time data reduction rules for this problem and obtain problem kernels consisting of 6k vertices for general graphs and 11k/3 vertices for planar graphs.

	Upper bounds for domination numbers of graphs using Turán’s Theorem and Lov́asz local lemma
	</summary>
	Let G be a connected graph of order n with vertex set V (G). A subset S ⊆ V (G) is an (a, b)-dominating set if every vertex v ∈ S is adjacent to at least a vertices in S and every v ∈ V \ S is adjacent to at least b vertices in S. The minimum cardinality of an (a,b)-dominating set of G is the (a,b)-domination number of G, denoted by γa,b(G). There are various results about upper bounds for γa,b(G) when G is regular or a and b are small numbers.
	In the first part of this paper, for a given graph G with the minimum degree of max{a, b}, we define a new graph G′ associated to G and show that the independence number of this graph is related to γa,b(G). In the next part, using Lov ́asz local lemma, we give a randomized approach to improve previous results in some special cases.

	Planar Bichromatic Bottleneck Spanning Trees
	</summary>
	Given a set P of n red and blue points in the plane, a planar bichromatic spanning tree of P is a geometric spanning tree of P, such that each edge connects between a red and a blue point, and no two edges intersect. In the bottleneck planar bichromatic spanning tree problem, the goal is to find a planar bichromatic spanning tree T, such that the length of the longest edge in T is minimized. In this paper, we show that this problem is NP-hard for points in general position. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time (8√2)-approximation algorithm, by showing that any bichromatic spanning tree of bottleneck λ can be converted to a planar bichromatic spanning tree of bottleneck at most 8√2λ.

	</summary>
	We prove the following generalised empty pentagon theorem: for every integer l ≥ 2, every sufficiently large set of points in the plane contains l collinear points or an empty pentagon. As an application, we settle the next open case of the “big line or big clique” conjecture of K ́ara, Po ́r, and Wood [Discrete Comput. Geom. 34(3):497–506, 2005].

	Planar Graphs have Bounded Queue-Number
	</summary>
	We show that planar graphs have bounded queue-number, thus proving a conjecture of Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg from 1992. The key to the proof is a new structural tool called layered partitions, and the result that every planar graph has a vertex-partition and a layering, such that each part has a bounded number of vertices in each layer, and the quotient graph has bounded treewidth. This result generalises for graphs of bounded Euler genus. Moreover, we prove that every graph in a minor-closed class has such a layered partition if and only if the class excludes some apex graph. Building on this work and using the graph minor structure theorem, we prove that every proper minor-closed class of graphs has bounded queue-number.
	
	Layered partitions have strong connections to other topics, including the following two examples. First, they can be interpreted in terms of strong products. We show that every planar graph is a subgraph of the strong product of a path with some graph of bounded treewidth. Similar statements hold for all proper minor-closed classes. Second, we give a simple proof of the result by DeVos et al. (2004) that graphs in a proper minor-closed class have low treewidth colourings.
