		Layered Separators in Minor-Closed Graph Classes with Applications
		</summary>
		Graph separators are a ubiquitous tool in graph theory and computer science. However, in some applications, their usefulness is limited by the fact that the separator can be as large as Ω(√n) in graphs with n vertices. This is the case for planar graphs, and more generally, for proper minor-closed classes. We study a special type of graph separator, called a layered separator, which may have linear size in n, but has bounded size with respect to a different measure, called the width. We prove, for example, that planar graphs and graphs of bounded Euler genus admit layered separators of bounded width. More generally, we characterise the minor-closed classes that admit layered separators of bounded width as those that exclude a fixed apex graph as a minor.
		We use layered separators to prove O(log n) bounds for a number of problems where O(√n) was a long-standing previous best bound. This includes the nonrepetitive chromatic number and queue-number of graphs with bounded Euler genus. We extend these results with a O(log n) bound on the nonrepetitive chromatic number of graphs excluding a fixed topological minor, and a logO(1) n bound on the queue-number of graphs excluding a fixed minor. Only for planar graphs were logO(1) n bounds previously known. Our results imply that every n-vertex graph excluding a fixed minor has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with n logO(1) n volume, whereas the previous best bound was O(n3/2).}}
