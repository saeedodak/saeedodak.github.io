		Layered Separators in Minor-Closed Graph Classes with Applications
		</summary>
		Graph separators are a ubiquitous tool in graph theory and computer science. However, in some applications, their usefulness is limited by the fact that the separator can be as large as Ω(√n) in graphs with n vertices. This is the case for planar graphs, and more generally, for proper minor-closed classes. We study a special type of graph separator, called a layered separator, which may have linear size in n, but has bounded size with respect to a different measure, called the width. We prove, for example, that planar graphs and graphs of bounded Euler genus admit layered separators of bounded width. More generally, we characterise the minor-closed classes that admit layered separators of bounded width as those that exclude a fixed apex graph as a minor.
		We use layered separators to prove O(log n) bounds for a number of problems where O(√n) was a long-standing previous best bound. This includes the nonrepetitive chromatic number and queue-number of graphs with bounded Euler genus. We extend these results with a O(log n) bound on the nonrepetitive chromatic number of graphs excluding a fixed topological minor, and a logO(1) n bound on the queue-number of graphs excluding a fixed minor. Only for planar graphs were logO(1) n bounds previously known. Our results imply that every n-vertex graph excluding a fixed minor has a 3-dimensional grid drawing with n logO(1) n volume, whereas the previous best bound was O(n3/2).}}

		On Generating Triangle-Free Graphs
		</summary>
		We show that the problem to decide whether a graph can be made triangle-free with at most k edge deletions remains NP-complete even when restricted to planar graphs of maximum degree seven. In addition, we provide polynomial-time data reduction rules for this problem and obtain problem kernels consisting of 6k vertices for general graphs and 11k/3 vertices for planar graphs.

		Upper bounds for domination numbers of graphs using Turán’s Theorem and Lov́asz local lemma
		</summary>
		Let G be a connected graph of order n with vertex set V (G). A subset S ⊆ V (G) is an (a, b)-dominating set if every vertex v ∈ S is adjacent to at least a vertices in S and every v ∈ V \ S is adjacent to at least b vertices in S. The minimum cardinality of an (a,b)-dominating set of G is the (a,b)-domination number of G, denoted by γa,b(G). There are various results about upper bounds for γa,b(G) when G is regular or a and b are small numbers.
		In the first part of this paper, for a given graph G with the minimum degree of max{a, b}, we define a new graph G′ associated to G and show that the independence number of this graph is related to γa,b(G). In the next part, using Lov ́asz local lemma, we give a randomized approach to improve previous results in some special cases.

		Planar Bichromatic Bottleneck Spanning Trees
		</summary>
		Given a set P of n red and blue points in the plane, a planar bichromatic spanning tree of P is a geometric spanning tree of P, such that each edge connects between a red and a blue point, and no two edges intersect. In the bottleneck planar bichromatic spanning tree problem, the goal is to find a planar bichromatic spanning tree T, such that the length of the longest edge in T is minimized. In this paper, we show that this problem is NP-hard for points in general position. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time (8√2)-approximation algorithm, by showing that any bichromatic spanning tree of bottleneck λ can be converted to a planar bichromatic spanning tree of bottleneck at most 8√2λ.

		EVERY LARGE POINT SET CONTAINS MANY COLLINEAR POINTS OR AN EMPTY PENTAGON
		</summary>
		We prove the following generalised empty pentagon theorem: for every integer l ≥ 2, every sufficiently large set of points in the plane contains l collinear points or an empty pentagon. As an application, we settle the next open case of the “big line or big clique” conjecture of K ́ara, Po ́r, and Wood [Discrete Comput. Geom. 34(3):497–506, 2005].
